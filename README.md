One game demonstrates the solar system. if you adjust the orintation of the star, the 
planet will follow the axis and stay in the same revolving plane.

The second one is a simple first person shooting game.

The third is a catch ball game. 

The purpose of these games are demonstrating the basic Unity functions.

The best one is the tank game, pls note I used left ctrl key for fire shells. 

You manipulate the green tank, those grey tanks are generated by the game to attack you.
